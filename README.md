# Assignment - CSS 1

***

## Configuration steps

* Fork this repository
* Clone your forked copy
* Run `yarn install` or similar to get this project's packages
* Configure your IDE to run Prettier with settings provided
    * Note: make sure Prettier runs for CSS and HTML, this might be disabled by default in Webstorm

## Please remember

* Use consistent commit messages `https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/`
* (Probably) the best source for technical information regarding this task: `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/`
* If you're hopelessly stuck for more than 20 or so minutes, don't hesitate to contact me
* HTML matters in this assignment, too. Try to use an appropriate tag for its function - f.e. `<header>` for a header and `<ul>` or `<ol>` for lists 
* Use your best stylistic judgment when it comes to creating elements described in formal requirements. Descriptions there are on the vague side on purpose - don't be afraid to make it pretty
* Anywhere in this project where a link is present - it does not have to lead anywhere, just be there for presentational purpose
* For any long-form text elements, use lorem ipsum
* Interactive elements should have hover and other applicable modifiers also styled
* Anywhere an image is mentioned, you can use a solid color or a gradient
* Styles should not be in a `<style>` tag, but in their own file

## Assignment goal
